        <h2>Evaluation of the Biosynthetic Proposal for the Synthesis of Marineosins A and B</h2>

        <h4>Experimental Section</h4>

        <span>All 1H & 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX-500 (500 MHz), Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz) or Bruker AV-NMR (600 MHz) instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to residual solvent peaks as an internal standard set to δH 7.26 or δC 77.0 (CDCl3) and δH 3.31 or δC 49.0 (CD3OD). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, br = broad, m = multiplet), integration, coupling constant (Hz). IR spectra were recorded as thin films and are reported in wavenumbers (cm-1). Low resolution mass spectra were obtained on an Agilent 1200 LCMS with electrospray ionization. High resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Waters Qtof-API-US plus Acquity system. The value Δ is the error in the measurement (in ppm) given by the equation Δ = [(ME – MT)/ MT] × 106, where ME is the experimental mass and MT is the theoretical mass. The HRMS results were obtained with ES as the ion source and leucine enkephalin as the reference. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin Elmer-341 polarimeter. Analytical thin layer chromatography was performed on 250 μM silica gel 60 F254 plates. Visualization was accomplished with UV light, and/or the use of ninhydrin, anisaldehyde and ceric ammonium molybdate solutions followed by charring on a hot-plate. Chromatography on silica gel was performed using Silica Gel 60 (230-400 mesh) from Sorbent Technologies. Analytical HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1200 analytical LCMS with UV detection at 214 nm and 254 nm along with ELSD detection. Solvents for extraction, washing and chromatography were HPLC grade. All reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and were used without purification. All polymer-supported reagents were purchased from Biotage, Inc. Flame-dried (under vacuum) glassware was used for all reactions. All reagents and solvents were commercial grade and purified prior to use when necessary. Mass spectra were obtained on a Micromass Q-Tof API-US mass spectrometer was used to acquire high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data.</span>
