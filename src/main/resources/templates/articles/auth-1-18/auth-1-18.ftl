        <span>Recently, Fenical and co-workers reported on the isolation, characterization, and biological evaluation of two novel spiroaminals, marineosins A (1) and B (2), from a marine- derived Streptomyces-related actinomycete (Figure 1).1 Bio- synthetically, 1 and 2 appear to be derived from previously unknown modifications within the prodigiosin-like pigment pathways,2 and both displayed inhibition of human colon carcinoma (HCT-116 IC50’s of 0.5 and 46 μM, repsectively), with 1 significantly more potent.1 Fenical also proposed a possible biosynthesis of 1 and 2 via an inverse-electron- demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction on acyclic C1-C25 substrate 5 that would form the pyran ring and spiroaminal in a single step (Figure 2).1 On the basis of the novel structure, the biological activity, and the enticing biosynthetic proposal for 1 and 2, efforts toward a biomimetic total synthesis of 1 and 2 were pursued in order to test the proposed biosynthesis.
Synthetic efforst focused on the biosynthesis proposed by Fenical in which a condensation between the C1-C9 bis- pyrrole 3 and the enone-containing C10-C24 pyrrole 4 was envisioned to deliver the Diels-Alder substrate 5. An intramolecular inverse-electron-demand hetero-DielssAlder</span>

        <span>reaction would then provide in a single step the spiroaminal pyranyl core 6. Subsequent reduction across C22-C23 and C6-C7 would provide marineosins A (1) and B (2). In this Letter, we describe the synthesis of 5, the acyclic C1-C25 biosynthetic intermediate, and attempts toward a biomimetic synthesis of 1 and 2; unfortuately, the biosynthetic proposal could not be validated in the laboratory.
        Synthetic efforts focused on the construction of the key C1-C9 bis-pyrrole 3 and the enone-containing C10-C24</span>

        <span>haloformylation was performed on 4-methoxy-3-pyrrolin-2- one 7 to provide bromoenamine 8 in 59% yield. Suzuki coupling with Boc-1H-pyrrol-2yl boronic acid delivered the Boc-protected analogue 9 of the C1-C9 3 in 48% yield.
        Retrosynthesis of the enone-containing C10-C24 pyrrole 4 led to a number of reasonable approaches (Scheme 2). In both disconnection routes a and b, the enone was envisioned to be installed through a cross-metathasis with 12. Discon- nection pathway a led to the 2-pyrrole organometallic (Li</span>

Similarly, via pathway b, wherein the R in 13 was a CH2Br or CH2OMs, SN2 chemistry also failed with organometallic reagents 14. Ultimately, addition of an octenyl Grignard to a protected pyrrole-2- carboxaldehyde proved effective, but with quite unexpected results.</span>

        <span>As shown in Scheme 3, treatment of Boc-protected pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde 15 with Gringard 16 provided the unexpected oxazolidinone 17, resulting from 1,2-addition, followed by cyclization, in 78% yield. Although this was not a productive venue to access 4, it led us to hypothesize a one-pot addition, rearrangement, deoxygenation, and deprotection cascade based on the precendent set forth by Muchowski.5 In 1985, Muchowski demonstrated that NaBH4 reduction of phenylsulfonamide-protected 2-carboxypyrroles 18 led directly to deoxygenated and deprotected congeners 23 (Scheme 4).5 Thus, we postulated that addition of Gringard 16 to pyrrole 24, followed by NaBH4, may lead directly to the desired 25 in a single pot. In the event, 25 was indeed produced in the one-pot cascade, but the major product 26 was delivered in a 1:10 ratio (25:26) in 70% yield.
        Ultimately, 25 could be delivered in high yield by a three- step sequence involving Grignard 16 addition to pyrrole aldehyde 24 to provide secondary alochol 26. Ley oxidation</span>

        <span>With 25 in hand, the stage was set for the cross-metathasis reaction to assemble the C10-C24 fragment 4.6 Once again, this “straightforward” approach provided unexpected results. Under standard cross-metathasis conditions with catalytic Grubbs II, 25, and 12 (Scheme 6), the desired 4 was produced as a minor product along with conjugate addition products 28 and 29. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first account of Grubbs II catalyzing 1,4-conjugate additions, and the reaction is quite general with respect to both electron- rich pyrroles and acyclic Michael acceptors.7 However, increasing catalyst loading from 0.5 to 30 mol % concomitant with lowering the temperature from 40 °C to room temperature allowed the cross-metathasis product 4 to be isolated in 40% yield.</span>

        <span>With the two biosynthetic fragments, 9, the C1-C9 Boc-protected 3, and the C10-C24 enone 4 in hand, an acid-mediated condensation smoothly formed the C9-C10 bond, delivering the C1-C25 acyclic precursor 5 for the proposed inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction in 92% yield (Scheme 7). Isolation of this highly</span>

        <span>colored poly pyrrole was difficult and required significant refinement to the isolation and purification steps, but 5 could ultimately be produced, purified via reverse phase chromatography, and stored in gram quantities. It is known that 5 and related prodigiosins exist as two stable isomers about the C8-C9 bond in solution, and the equilibrium distribution is dependent on both solvent and pH. For clarity as a DA substrate, we depicted a single isomer 5.8 At this point, we had completed the synthesis of the key biosynthetic precursors 3-5 prescribed by Fenical and were ready to attempt the proposed inverse-electron- demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction.
        As shown in Scheme 8, the proposed inverse-electron- demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 5 to deliver 6 proved unsuccessful. Over months of study and hundreds of reaction</span>

        <span>conditions (heat, microwave, photochemical, Lewis acid catalysis, mineral acid catalysis, solvent, and additives), we were unable to effect the conversion of 5 to 6 in anything other than presumed trace amounts detected only by LCMS.9 On the basis of these results, we enlisted molecular modeling in an attempt to understand why the Diels-Alder reaction failed. Molecular mechanics sampling for 5 was conducted starting from the hypothesized transition geometry using both stochastic and systematic conformer searches and gradient energy minimization with the Merck MMFF94 forcefield as implemented in the MOE software package (Chemical Computing Group).10 Analysis of the top 10,000 conformers with the lowest relative energies (20 kcal from lowest energy conformer) indicated a failure to identify favorable Diels- Alder transition state geometries. Out of 10,000 systematic search conformers generated for 5, less than 15% of the structures sampled have a folded topology, and the key atoms remained separated by almost 5 Å (Figure 3). Of those conformers with a “folded” topology, 15% form intramo- lecular hydrogen bonds.8 Thus, as a result of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and a large degree of conformational flexibility present in the long, alkyl linker moeity, the intramolecular Diels-Alder mechanism is likely energeti- cally disfavored. Moreover, attempts at intermolecular vari- ants9 proved equally unsuccessful, suggesting the C8-C9 olefin of the extended poly pyrrole π-system is not a competent dienophile.
        In summary, we evaluated the biosynthetic proposal put forth by Fenical and co-workers for marineosins A and B.</span>

        <span>In short order, we prepared the proposed biosynthetic building blocks 3 and 4 and synthesized the key C1-C25 inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder substrate 5 in 8 steps (5.1% overall yield). Hundreds of reaction conditions were explored, but the proposed biomimetic intramolecular inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction was not successful. Modeling studies supported the inability of 5 to affect this transformation. Thus, a fundamentally new synthetic strategy is now underway to synthesize marin- eosines A and B. In the course of this work, we also discovered a novel Grubbs II catalyzed 1,4-conjugate addition reaction. While synthetically we could not validate the biosynthetic proposal, an enzyme-templated process in nature may still align 5 in a manner conducive for the Diels-Alder reaction to occur.
